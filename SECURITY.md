## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in AI-Enhanced Search, please report it privately by:

### Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories
1. Go to the project's GitHub page
2. Click on "Security" tab
3. Click "Report a vulnerability"
4. Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

### Alternative Method: Email
Send an email to the project maintainers with:
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability
- **Details**: 
  - Description of the vulnerability
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Potential impact
  - Suggested fix (if known)

## What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., injection, authentication bypass, privilege escalation)
- **Component affected** (e.g., web interface, document processing, RAG engine)
- **Attack vector** (local, network, remote)
- **Impact assessment** (data exposure, system compromise, etc.)
- **Proof of concept** (if safe to share)
- **Suggested mitigation** (if known)

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week of initial response
- **Fix Development**: Depending on severity (1-4 weeks)
- **Release**: Security fixes are prioritized for immediate release

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Features
- ✅ Local-only operation (no external API calls)
- ✅ No authentication required (private network assumption)
- ✅ Input validation for document processing
- ✅ Path traversal protection

### Known Security Limitations
- ⚠️ **No authentication system** - suitable for private networks only
- ⚠️ **No rate limiting** - vulnerable to DoS attacks if exposed publicly
- ⚠️ **File upload without scanning** - malicious documents could cause issues
- ⚠️ **No access controls** - all users have full access to all documents

### Security Best Practices for Deployment

#### Network Security
- Deploy on private networks only
- Use reverse proxy with authentication for public access
- Implement HTTPS in production
- Consider VPN access for remote users

#### System Security
- Run with minimal privileges (non-root user)
- Use containerization (Docker) for isolation
- Regular security updates for dependencies
- Monitor system resources and logs

#### Document Security
- Scan uploaded documents for malware
- Validate file types and sizes
- Implement access controls for sensitive documents
- Regular backups with encryption

## Disclosure Policy

- We practice **responsible disclosure**
- Security vulnerabilities will be disclosed publicly after a fix is available
- Credit will be given to researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly
- We request that you do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until a fix is released

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1 → 1.0.2)
- Documented in the changelog with severity ratings
- Announced in GitHub releases
- Tagged with `security` label

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns that are not vulnerabilities, please:
- Create a GitHub Discussion with the `security` label
- Check existing documentation and issues first
